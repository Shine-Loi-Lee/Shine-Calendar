# Shine Calendar

Today is **[Monday, 24 - 10 - 22]**

# Introduction
What is the Shine Calendar?

Why was it created?

# Calendar Structure
* Total Days in a Year: 364 (13 months x 28 days)
* Each month has 28 days, except for leap adjustments.
* Week structure remains consistent (Monday to Sunday).

# Leap Year Rules
* **Every 7 years**: The 13th month has 35 days instead of 28.
* **Every 28 years**: Both the 12th and 13th months have 35 days instead of 28.

# How the Calendar Works
* The calendar begins on May 14, 2001 (Year 1, Month 1, Day 1).
* Days progress sequentially without irregular month lengths.
* Leap year calculations ensure consistent long-term alignment.

# Advantages of the Shine Calendar
* No irregular month lengths: Every month (except leap years) has exactly 4 weeks.
* Easier date calculations: No need for 30/31-day month adjustments.
* Weekday consistency: Every year starts on the same weekday.
