# Shine Calendar

Today is **[Sunday, 25 - 1 - 14]**

## 1. Introduction
The Shine Calendar is a new conceptual calendar system that defines May 14, 2001, as Year 1, Month 1, Day 1. It provides consistency by maintaining fixed-length months. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, which has irregular month lengths, the Shine Calendar simplifies date calculations.

## 2. Calendar Structure
* Total Days in a Year: 364 (13 months x 28 days)
* Each month has 28 days, except for leap adjustments.
* Week structure remains consistent (Monday to Sunday).

### 2-1. Leap Year Rules
The Shine Calendar follows a structured leap year system to maintain synchronization.
* **Every 7 years**: The 13th month has 35 days instead of 28.
* **Every 28 years**: Both the 12th and 13th months have 35 days instead of 28.

## 3. Advantages of the Shine Calendar
* Fixed-length months: All months have the same structure, eliminating inconsistencies.
* Easy date calculations: No need to account for variable month lengths.
